For @Data annotation added boolean option 'trackChanges', 
to use this options class must be inhefited from abstract class lombok.ChangeTracker.
This option allow to recognize is setter was caller for particular field, after object created.

Example:
-------
@Data(trackChanges = true)
public class Person extends ChangeTracker {
	private String name;
	private int age;
}

...
Person person = new Person();
person.setName("Smith");
System.out.println("Is name changed: " + person.isChanged("name")); // Is name changed: true
System.out.println("Is age changed: " + person.isChanged("age")); // Is age changed: false
...

One case of usage: 
-----------------
After deserialization of object if field contain default value we can recognize
is default value was setted explicitly from source or not.
